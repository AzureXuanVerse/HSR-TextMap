-"\"Hehe, children, the Membrance Maze's harvest season is upon us once again. So... what must we prepare?\" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.\\n\"The Brew Festival!\" The fairies cheered in unison.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump — the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low — until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep — \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant — so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze.

+"\"Hehe, children, the Membrance Maze's harvest season is upon us once again. So... what must we prepare?\" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.\\n\"The Brew Festival!\" The fairies cheered in unison.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump — the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.\\n\\nThat's how every Brew Festival goes.\\nBut this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, \"Has anyone seen Relimem?\"\\n\\nThe fairies searched high and low — until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep — \"Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!\"\\n\\nIn the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant — so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze.
